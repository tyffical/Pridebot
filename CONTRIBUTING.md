# Contributing to Pridebot

## Getting started

### **Before you begin:** Please contact one of the Pridebot maintainers in the BLAHAJGang Discord Server who will be able to walk you through this repository and how you can best contribute! Otherwise, you might risk working on something that's already in progress or going through unnecessary effort to get your contributions approved.

# Ways to Contribute

## Suggesting Features / Filing Bug Reports

Have an idea for Pridebot? Notice a bug in the bot? Awesome! [Open an issue](https://github.com/tyffical/Pridebot/issues/new) and fill it out with as many details as you can. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the feature you want added or the bug you want to fix, and assign one of our code contributors to it or walk you through writing the code for it yourself.

## Contributing Code

**IMPORTANT:** If you would like to independently contribute code to the bot, we assume you have a basic working knowledge of Git/GitHub, Python, and Discord.py. If you don't, feel free to ask one of the bot's maintainers to help you make your first contribution - we'd be more than happy to take some time to teach you!

Good to go and confident in your ability to contribute independently? Let's get started!

1. Fork the repository using the Fork button in the top right hand corner to make your own copy of the repository.
2. Use your Git tool of choice (Git Command Line or GitHub Desktop) to clone your fork locally.
3. Open the repository in your favorite code editor - we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or PyCharm.
4. Make the changes you'd like to contribute - whether that's a new command, new reaction response, new feature, or bug fix.
5. Test your code! Use the [Quickstart](https://github.com/tyffical/Pridebot#quickstart) in the README to host the bot locally and test your changes. Make sure they're working as intended with no bugs!
6. Commit and push your code to GitHub! Use the `git commit` and `git push` commands (or the buttons on GitHub Desktop) to push your code to your remote fork. **Make sure that all your commits use one of the prefixes below to indicate what kind of commit it is!**

## [Contributing Docs / Code] Open a Pull Request

When you're done with the changes you want to contribute, open a pull request on GitHub, making sure that the base branch of the PR is the `dev` branch of our repository. **We do not accept pull request directly to our main branch anymore.** Don't worry if you accidentally make the pull request on the main branch, though - we can change it easily.

When creating your PR, make sure to name it with a prefix (see above) and concise title that effectively summarizes your changes! In the body, include a few bullets that outline what your PR will contribute to our codebase as well as examples of any new features being implemented. If you're unsure if your PR is written correctly, feel free to ping a maintainer in the BLAHAJGang Discord Server and we'd be more than happy to walk you through the process!

Once you submit your PR, ping one of our maintainers in the Discord server, who will review your changes and make any suggestions, edits, or requests as needed to ensure that your code is working properly and meets our standards. If your code has any merge conflicts, we'll work with you to resolve those as well.

Once your code is satisfactory and good to go, we'll approve it and merge it into our dev branch, where it'll eventually make its way to our live bot!

### Your PR is merged!

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the [contributor chart](https://github.com/tyffical/Pridebot/graphs/contributors) and be a part of the Pridebot community!

Congratulations! The BLAHAJGang community thanks you for your contribution. :sparkles:
