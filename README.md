# Pridebot

## Description
BLAHAJGang's custom-made pride Discord bot that reacts to pride-related messages with pride emojis, as well as some other Blahaj-tastic Easter eggs!

## Add to Server
Note: BLAHAJGang-specific emojis will not work unless those emojis are also included in the server and have the same names.
