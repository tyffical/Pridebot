# Get Pride Bot Running ASAP!

## Fine, Do it on My Computer

### Wait, I need stuff already installed?!

- [That Snakey Program](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [The manager of said Snakey Program](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Some Gitty Stuff](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - [(Or another alternative _shh_)](https://desktop.github.com)
- [Discord Account for Programming!!](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)

### Wow, I have to do work :(

_Note: Right now, you will have to edit `ids.py` to contain role IDs and channel IDs from your test server; otherwise the bot may not function properly._

1. First you gotta get this code stuff onto ur computer.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tyffical/Pridebot.git
   cd Pridebot
   ```
2. (OPTIONAL) Do this difficult thing if you want to idk.
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Do as BLAHAJ asked and install these tings using a command called `pip` (no it's not talking about fruit seeds).
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Here's the hard stuff. Copy the `.env.example` file and call it `.env`, and edit it to include your Discord bot token (this is secret stuff so don't go telling all your friends it!! Don't know where it is? It's probably in the "Bot" settings of your [application settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications)!
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Pray to our lord BLAHAJ and set Pride Bot off.
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```
6. Bing Bang Bosh you've done it. Time to pull a table out of your [rear end](https://youtu.be/zHUEs22lhvQ?t=3) and treat yourself to somthing nice!

### WOO IT WORKS ONLINE

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/tyffical/Pridebot)](https://repl.it/github/tyffical/Pridebot)

Boring Stuff: Make sure to add your bot token by clicking on the padlock symbol on the left sidebar, and then inserting "TOKEN" into the `key` text field and your bot token into the `value` text field.

ALso Boring Stuff: You can turn on the `Always On` setting (found by clicking on the repl name) to keep the bot continuously running!

# Allow me to help

**OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING PRIDE BOT BETTER <3** YOU BETTER KEEP UP WITH OUR CHANGES OR IT WILL MAKE BLAHAJ CRY
